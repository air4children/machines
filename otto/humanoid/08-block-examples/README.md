# Coding with otto-robot and Blockly
## Usage
1. Prepare robot for its connection to a computer
2. Open Blockly application
* Blocky - Ubuntu 18.04x64
```
cd ~/blockly
npm start #to test app
```
3. Connect USB cable to otto-robot
4. Choose microcontroller (Arduino Nano) and Select Port number (COMX or USBX) where $X is the number of port
5. Load example
6. Then you can play and explore Blockly application
7. Disconnect USB cable from the computer and otto-robot
8. Close Blocky application
9. Put otto-robot back into its package
