# Assembly instructions
## First time construction. 
In general all went smoothly with minor issues such as the use of the 
appropriate library and perhaps the use of a file to allow some piece
fit in the 3d-printed pieces of otto.  
See photos of construction [here](first-time-constructions/).

## Some warnings
* Careful with the small screw, it is easy to lost them (put them in a container)
* 16.5 step is the collocation of the ultrasound sensor
* 22 should be done (connection of batteries holder) in step 16
* 26 should be done (connection of bluetooth dongle) in step 16

## Can be improved
* comfortable screwdrivers  (professional ones)
* container for screws 
* scalper to cut pieces
* mini round file
