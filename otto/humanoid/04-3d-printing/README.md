# 3D printing
## Recommendations for 3D printing
CAD files should be property oriented and centered to then do printing with the following recommended parameters:
* PLA material.
* No need supports or rafts.
* Resolution: 0.30mm
* Fill density 20%

For slicing and generating the g code for the machine, there is free slicer software like [Cura](https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura).   
Nine hours are the estimated time to 3D print for a full set of parts for one Otto Humanoid.
