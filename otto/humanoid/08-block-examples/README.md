# Coding with otto-robot and Blockly
## Usage
01. Prepare robot for its connection to a computer
02. Open Blockly application
03. Connect USB cable to otto-robot
04. Choose microcontroller (Arduino Nano) and Select Port number (COMX or USBX) where $X is the number of port
05. Load example
06. Then you can play and explore Blockly application
07. Disconnect USB cable from the computer and otto-robot
08. Close Blocky application
09. Put otto-robot back into its package

## Examples
Examples of the blockly and otto-robot are organised as basic, intermediate, advance and experimental.   
Each example includes description, fundamental concepts, block diagrams, exercises, and c-based code.
